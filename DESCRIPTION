Description: The package allows for the Estimation of Sample-size and Power by
    Exploring Simulated Study Outcomes for a main effect model where the single
    covariate is an environmental or life style exposure. It supports
    simulation-based power calculation for stand-alone case-control studies and
    for case-control analyses nested in cohort studies, that take account of
    realistic assessment error.
